# PortalTime
<h2>Track portal expiration times in Path of Exile 2</h2>

I'm approaching the end of my offline devleopment and expect to release this on GitHub in either February or March of 2025. The core functionality of it is working well, so it's all about adding the polish right now.

To-Do:
* Fleshing out the rest of the user settings, including timer styling and PoE2 locations file editing
* Currently uses FileSystemWatcher, but adding option for manual interval checks as well
* Get global key bindings working

Future Versions:
* Provide an option to use SharpDX (an old tool) or Windows SDK to create a DirectX overlay for those who play PoE2 on only one display in full screen mode. Currrently PortalTime works either on another monitor or over top of PoE2 in Window or Windowed Fullscreen mode.
